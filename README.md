# BiFrEE

BiFrEE -Binding Free Energy Estimator- is an open library to estimate binding free energies of proteins complexes with the MM/GBSA method.

## Make a wish

We wish we can in the future implement MM/PBSA and many other approaches to estimate the binding
free energy between two or more molecules, any kind.
